# Probability and statistics

## Monte Carlo method
Estimating values of several integrals using Monte Carlo method and saving data to files. <br />
For n in {50, 100, ... 5000} algorithm is repeated k = 50 times. 
## PI
Estimating the value of **Ï€** using Monte Carlo method. <br />
For **n** in {50, 100, ... 5000} algorithm is repeated **k** = 50 times and data is saved to a file.
